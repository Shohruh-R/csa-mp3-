# 2024 Question 2

## This question is about...
- This question involves a scoreboard for a game. The game is played between two teams who alternate turns so
that at any given time, one team is active and the other team is inactive. During a turn, a team makes one or
more plays. Each play can score one or more points and the team’s turn continues, or the play can fail, in
which case no points are scored and the team’s turn ends. The code of this has to be written in a seprate class with all the instance varibles, constructors, and methods. 

## Struggles with this question...
- The main problem with this question was making sure that the scores accurately keep track of the scores and knowing when a team was inactive or active. 
    
## Prior expereiences that helped...
- Knowing how to write classes before this is vital as well knowing how to use if and elses. 

## What I learned by doing this question...
- How to effectively use odd and even numbers to suggest a change in the activity which was a creative way of doing the switich, which can also be used in other projects.
